Python has a Module Index on its main website it has built-in 
and external modules
'''
'''
To use an external module you need to download them into using 
the pip command/program. Open your command prompt
first check for pip but should be preinstalled for my version
pip -- checks if its downloaded and what version

then use command pip install "file name"
then it will install it into your python. 
Most but not all use pip if not then it should have instructions

afterwards it will be placed into a site-packages folder for your further use
you can then import your file into your shell and code away


To remove said module you simply use command pip uninstall "file name"
